# The Marak Score
The **Marak Score** is a simple score system to evaluate the risk of an open source repository.

Repositories with high score tend to be highly used and well maintained. Well maintained repositories tend to have a high number of different contributors, high frequency of commits, and high number of issues.

Repositories with high score have different risks. Some of the risks are:
* Security issues. The best example of this is log4j, a repository highly used and maintained by a bunch of developers as a side project that provoked a [high security issue in December 2021](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html).
* Maintainers hijacking the repository. There are many examples of maintainers removing or modifying the code of a repository in malicious ways. One of them was [Marak](https://github.com/Marak), who removed the code of the `faker.js` and `colors.js` repositories.
